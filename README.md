# Python Basic to Advance

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to documenting my Python learning journey, from fundamental concepts to advanced topics. Each section is organized into folders representing different topics, and within each folder, we'll find code examples, detailed explanations, and a markdown file that breaks down the concepts.

## Sections Covered

### 1. Basics

- Variables, Data Types, Input/Output
- Conditionals (if, else, elif)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions (def, arguments, return values)

### 2. Intermediate Concepts

- Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)
- File Handling (read, write, append)
- Exception Handling (try, except, finally)
- Modules and Packages

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- Magic Methods (**init**, **str**, etc.)

### 4. Advanced Topics

- Decorators
- Generators
- Context Managers
- Multi-threading and Multiprocessing

### Syntax

```python
my_dist = {key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3}
```

### Example:

```python
person = {
  "name": "Shihab",
  "age": 25,
  "country": "Bangladesh"
}

print(person["name"]) # Accessing a value using a key
```

### Common Dictionary Operations:

- get(): Return the value for a key, or a default value if the key doesn't exist.
- items(): Return a view object with all key-value pairs.
- keys(): Return a view object with all the keys.
- values(): Return a view object with all the values.
- update(): Update the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary.
